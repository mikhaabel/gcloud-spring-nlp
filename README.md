### Cloud Service for Natural Language Processing (Spring Boot in Google Cloud and Natural Language API)

I will explain and show how to config, develop and deploy server-side Spring Boot application into Google Cloud, using App Engine and Natural Language API. There will be five steps:

1. Generating Spring boot application and its initial development
2. Enabling Google cloud platform: App Engine and Natural Language API
3. Updating application so it can be deployed on App Engine
4. Setting up and developing NLP
5. Deploying working application to App Engine


Back-end will be REST API, built on Spring. API endpoints serve as internal front-end and external ones.

Front-end will be integrated into Spring Thymeleaf module. UI is a minimalistic yet nice input-form and result, served from back-end.

From Google Cloud platform will be used:
- App Engine to deploy application
- NLP API to run Google machine learning analytics from unstructured text
